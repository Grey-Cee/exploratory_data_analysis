# Customer Segmentation Analysis README

## Overview
This repository contains a customer segmentation analysis project aimed at understanding customer behavior. The analysis utilizes K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to gain insights into customer segmentation patterns.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for each stage of the analysis.
  - `01_data_preparation.ipynb`: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
  - `02_eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover key trends and patterns in the data.
  - `03_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Feature engineering techniques, including PCA.
  - `04_customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Customer segmentation using K-means clustering.
- **results/**: Stores visualizations, tables, and summaries of the analysis results.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, its goals, and how to navigate the repository.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
2. Open and run each notebook in the following order:
   - `01_data_preparation.ipynb`
   - `02_eda.ipynb`
   - `03_feature_engineering.ipynb`
   - `04_customer_segmentation.ipynb`
3. Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the analysis steps.

## Results
The `results/` directory contains visualizations and summaries of the key findings from the customer segmentation analysis. These include:
- Segmented customer groups based on behavior patterns.
- Insights into customer preferences, spending habits, and other relevant metrics.
- Visualizations depicting the clusters and their characteristics.
